        Why Pomotto?
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        <b>Introducing Pomotto:</b> A fresh and minimalist take on the Pomodoro technique that keeps you accountable, focused, and energized throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        As someone with a hyper-focused mind, I often found myself so engrossed in work that I'd lose track of time and forget about the world around me. After trying numerous Pomodoro apps, I still couldn't find one that allowed me to harness the power of my focus without risking complete disconnection from my surroundings or falling too deep into rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        That's why I created Pomotto – a solution designed to address these challenges and enhance your productivity workflow. By leveraging Mac's Do Not Disturb (DnD) feature <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-do-not-disturb-mchl999b7c1a/mac" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>, Pomotto allows you to focus deeply while ensuring critical notifications still come through, striking the perfect balance between concentration and staying connected.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-lg">
        <li>Sound reminders at the end of each session to gently pull you out of deep focus</li>
        <li>Integration with Mac's DnD for distraction-free focus periods</li>
        <li>Preservation of critical notifications you can't afford to miss, keeping you connected to important matters (via DnD)</li>
        <li>Simple, intuitive design with minimal complexity to avoid distracting your focused mind</li>
        <li>Sensible defaults and minimal configuration options to prevent falling into setup rabbit holes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        These features work in harmony to ensure a balanced and sustainable work rhythm. Pomotto helps you leverage your ability to hyper-focus while providing a structured way to control your tendency to pursue rabbit holes endlessly.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Power of Pomodoro</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        The Pomodoro technique, recommended by productivity expert Tim Ferriss in his book Four Hour Work Week, leverages Parkinson's Law – the idea that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. By setting focused work intervals, you create a sense of urgency and improve productivity. <a href="https://fourhourworkweek.com/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        While it may seem counterintuitive to break your focus, especially for those who thrive in deep work states, the Pomodoro technique actually helps control and balance your energy in a more sustainable way. Studies have shown that regular breaks can improve focus, creativity, and overall productivity. <a href="https://thewellbeingthesis.org.uk/foundations-for-success/importance-of-taking-breaks-and-having-other-interests/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a> <a href="https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/taking-breaks/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a>
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Philosophy: Simplicity Meets Functionality</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        At the heart of Pomotto's design is a commitment to simplicity and minimalism. I believe that the best tools are those that get out of your way and let you focus on what matters most – your work. With a clean interface, intuitive controls, and carefully curated customization options, Pomotto ensures you spend less time setting up and more time being productive.
